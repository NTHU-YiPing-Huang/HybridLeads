What to do:

0. Create a 4-site MPO for tight-binding model. The first two sites are in real space and the last two sites are in k space. Find the ground state for N=2 by DMRG; check the energy is correct.

1. Find the ground state of the left infinite tight-binding lead using iTDVP. Follow the code in itdvp/. Set mu=muL.

2. Find the ground state of the right infinite tight-binding lead using iTDVP. Follow the code in itdvp/. Set mu=muR.

3.
